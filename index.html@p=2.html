									<p>Serebro Nabora is an annual international type conference held in Moscow. Today’s graphic designers are clamoring for typographic knowledge. Serebro Nabora came to address this problem. The first annual Serebro Nabora conference was attended by participants from every part of Russia and the neighbouring countries. It proved a resounding success and became one of the most significant events for the local design community. The need for a setting for typographic learning combined with social interaction among graphic design professionals was so palpable that the idea immediately took hold. The venue quickly became the social centre for the graphic design professionals of Russia and other countries of the former USSR. Type designers, graphic designers, calligraphers, and anyone interested in typography found an avenue of professional exchange and a memorable occasion to get together at the conference. In 2013, the Conference became international in scope, with speakers and audience hailing from around the world.</p>

																											<h5 class="subtitle">Glyphs Introductory Workshop</h5>
													
																											<div class="description content"><p>We will start by sketching a letter and digitising it. Then, we will add some letters, export a font, and test it in InDesign. In the afternoon, we will add more letters to the font, space them, optimise them for the screen, but also add diacritics, and produce combined letters. At the end of the day, you will have a pretty good start for your first font.<br />
Requirements:<br />
No prior experience required, some experience with Bézier-based vector drawing tools useful.<br />
Bring your MacBook (OS X 10.9.5 or later).<br />
Download and install the Glyphs trial from www.glyphsapp.com/buy.</p>

																											<h5 class="subtitle">Letterpress Light, workshop</h5>
													
																											<div class="description content"><p>In today’s world of digital fonts, digital layouts and e-publishing, designers are increasingly removed from physically handling the objects they design. While this is becoming more and more true of books, ads, brochures and other printed ephemera, it has long been the case with typographic design. We think this is part of the reason for the current popularity of letterpress in design circles. Letterpress printing deals with physical typographic objects and allows designers to touch and feel the objects they work with on a daily basis.<br />
This workshop is for participants to get a brief feel for letterpress printing. In the workshop, participants can handle letterforms and work together to create typographic compositions. We will use a limited set of wood type, cut paper and acrylic letterforms in latin and cyrilic scripts. In this guided workshop, participants will “print” with raised letterforms to create typographic experiments using stamping and rubbing techniques that mimic normal letterpress. This workshop will be completely experimental, allowing designers to push the boundaries of typographic form in new ways and in the process discover more expressive solutions to typographic problems.</p>

But the font is not just the letters and digits and spaces between them. What happens after the glyphs are done and the spaces are set, especially if we mean rather a large foundry than an individual designer? The modest heroes of the type world are going to tell about the functioning of the technical department in a type foundry, the interaction between type designers and type technologists, the stages between the design of the first style and the release of the type family, tuning Robofont and making the most of Fontlab… and the importance of being a coder.</p>

Later on he did design work for cultural institutions in Berlin aside of teaching mathematics and arts and crafts at the Menzel High School. He started his career as a typography teacher in 1971 at the Bielefeld University of Applied Sciences, and run the first digital design competitionin Europe, the PAGE Wettbewerb in 1989.<br />
Gerd was fascinated by the Bauhaus since he bought the catalogue of the first great Bauhaus exhibition in Germany after the war, Stuttgart 1955. One of his seminal books is ‘bauhaus. typografie, drucksachen, reklame’ (bauhaus. typography, printed matter, commercial art) for Edition Marzona in 1984 which will be published in Russian, updated and enriched, in 2017. He designed a pile of art and design books, way finding systems in public buildings, and some important and prize winning exhibitions about Nazi time. He was teaching abroad at the NCAD in Dublin, Ireland, the NSCAD in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, the Vietnam University of Fine Arts in Hanoi, and the Universidad de Costa Rica, to mention only a few.

																											<div class="bio content"><p>Patrick Goossens is a historian specialising in the history of printing techniques located in Antwerp, Belgium. He is a founding member of the Friends of the Plantin-Moretus Museum, and a volunteer in several printing museums throughout Belgium and abroad. After getting his history degree at Antwerp and Louvain University, he started to collect books, and whilst doing so, found an advert declaring &#8216;why buy more books, print them yourself&#8217;, which led to the purchase of a simple press. At the time, in the late seventies, the intention was to publish archival resources. This however did not remain the case and the urge to collect printing equipment took on a life of its own, leading to a large collection of nineteenth century printing machines (hand and cylinder presses), type foundry equipment and associated paraphernalia. Using this collection as industrial archaeological evidence, Goossens returned to archival sources to try to reconstruct the history of printing’s technological evolution. In this vein he has, along with Bob Oldham, undertaken a new study of George Clymer’s Columbian hand press, outlining the technological developments that lead to its invention two hundred years ago. The two have also collated a census of still-existing Columbians. The result of all the research will eventually be the groundwork for a PhD on the subject.<br />
Goossens’ collection is far from being an inert and static accumulation – it is a living archive, and even the machinery that is currently in disrepair, is just waiting for a new lease of life. Furthermore, Goossens’ collection is a laboratory, and to date Goossens has made hands-on forays into casting historical typefaces, engraving new matrices and has made a full-scale reproduction of a sixteenth century common press. Goossens is also concerned with the relationship of craftsmen with their tools, and latterly with machinery. This interest stems from the fact that he is the current incumbent in charge of the artisanal bakery that has been in the family since 1884, and which is the source of income for his archive.</p>

																											<div class="bio content"><p>Brody Neuenschwander is a text artist and calligrapher. He studied at Princeton University and the Courtauld Institute, where he completed his PhD in 1986. At the same time he studied calligraphy at the Roehampton Institute.<br />
From the start, Neuenschwander asked serious questions about the place of calligraphy in the modern world. What is it? How is it used? Where should it be headed?<br />
In 1989 Neuenschwander began a twenty year collaboration with director Peter Greenaway, providing live-action calligraphy for the films <em>Prospero’s Books</em> and <em>The Pillow Book</em>, as well as for the operas <em>Writing to Vermeer</em> and <em>Columbus</em> and many other projects.<br />
Though the mark of the pen is usually present in Neuenschwander’s work, so are typographic letters, scratched letters, drawings and paintings. The question is posed again and again, “Is this an image or is this a text”.<br />
In 2004 Neuenschwander taught at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, researching the development of text art in the 20<sup>th.</sup> Recently projects have included video installations, stained glass, monumental texts in metal and stage performances with live calligraphy.<br />
Neuenschwander’s work attempts to bridge the gap between conceptual art and the acts of drawing, painting, writing. Neither the medium nor the message is the message. Both are involved in the dialectic between the artist and his experience of the world.</p>
